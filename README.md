# BatCoach
This is a tool for managing an online cricket team at battrick.org through a local web interface.
HTML files saved from battrick.org are saved in a directory, and imported into the app. 
The app parses the HTML files, tracking player stats and attributes.

##Status of development
This project is in the very early stages of development; a scaffold UI has been created.

##How to run
Currently, the server can be started with `python BatCoach/src/server/__init__.py` and navigating to `localhost:9090` in a browser.
